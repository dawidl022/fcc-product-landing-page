# FCC: Product Landing Page

Third project in FreeCodeCamp Resposive Web Design course.

What I learnt:
- Form fields must have the `name` attribute in order to be sumbitted.

What I had difficulties with:
- Making the YT iframe resposive
- Needed to add some pixel fixed padding to make the HTML bookmark scroll to the
right place with the sticky topbar in place.
